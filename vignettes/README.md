Compiled vignettes from the cran version of 'osmplotr' are here:

* [downloading data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/osmplotr/vignettes/downloading-data.html)

* [making maps](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/osmplotr/vignettes/making-maps.html)

These vignettes have since been rewritten. The `.md` files of the current
versions can be viewed but contain no graphical output. To see the full output,
compile either by:

1. Running the makefile to compile and view html versions of the vignettes; or  
2. Loading the `.Rmd` files in RStudio and `knit` to html
