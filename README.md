# urbanplotr

R package to produce visually impressive customisable images of urban areas from
OpenStreetMap data, like this:

Images are only likely to work well for urban areas with high densities of OSM
structures. Although it is possible to simply plot streets, better images often
result from ignoring streets and instead plotting buildings and other
structures.
