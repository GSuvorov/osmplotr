\usage{
\method{plot}{osm.basemap}(xylims = xylims, filename = NULL, width = 480,
  bg = "gray20", graphic.device = "png", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{xylims}{= range to be plotted as returned from get.xylims ()}

\item{filename}{= name of plot file; default=NULL plots to screen device (low
quality and likely slow)}

\item{width}{= width of graphics file (in px; default 480).}

\item{bg}{= background colour of map (default = "gray20")}

\item{graphic.device}{= "png" (default), "jpeg", "png", or "tiff"}

\item{...}{other parameters to be passed to graphic device (such as width and
height; see ?png, for example, for details)}
}
\value{
nothing (generates file of specified type).
}
\description{
Generates a base OSM plot ready for polygon and line objects to be overlain
with add.osm.polygons () and add.osm.lines (). NOTE: Graphics files must be
closed after finishing map with dev.off() or graphics.off(). Files size may
be adjusted by width only: height is automatically calculated from the aspect
ratio of the bounding box.
