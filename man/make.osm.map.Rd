\usage{
make.osm.map(filename = NULL, bbox = c(-0.15, 51.5, -0.1, 51.52),
  roads = TRUE, cols = get.colours(), remove.data = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{= name of plot file; default=NULL plots to screen device (low
quality and likely slow)}

\item{bbox}{= the bounding box for the map. Default is central London
(-0.15,51.5,-0.1,51.52).}

\item{roads}{= TRUE (default) plot lines for roads (ways)}

\item{cols}{= a list of colours matching all object types listed in
get.suffixes (); defaults to values returned by get.colours ()}

\item{remove.data}{= TRUE. To save working memory, data for each type of
structure are temporarily saved to disk and removed from memory. If
remove.data = FALSE, saved objects are *NOT* removed at end.}
}
\value{
nothing (generates graphics device of specified type; progress is
dumped to screen, including time taken).
}
\description{
Makes an entire OSM map for the given bbox by downloading all data.  This
function can take quite some time (tens of minutes) to execute the two
primary steps of downloading and processing the raw OSM data.  For this
reason, this function is not intended to be actually run; rather it serves to
demonstrate how all functions may be combined to generate a map.
}
\examples{
# These illustrate the key steps of the function:
\dontrun{
 bbox <- c (-0.15, 51.51, -0.14, 51.52)
 datBU <- extract.osm.objects (bbox=bbox, key="building")
 datH <- extract.osm.objects (bbox=bbox, key="highway")
 datG <- extract.osm.objects (bbox=bbox, key="grass")
 datP <- extract.osm.objects (bbox=bbox, key="park")
 datW <- extract.osm.objects (bbox=bbox, key="water")
}
plot.osm.basemap (xylims=get.xylims (datBU))
add.osm.objects (datH, col="white")
add.osm.objects (datBU, col="orange")
add.osm.objects (datG, col="lawngreen")
add.osm.objects (datP, col="lawngreen")
}
